We present two Matlab-based routines, Radon_inverse and Radon_forward,
that perform discrete inverse and forward Radon transforms.  These 
frequency-based methods offer the user flexible choices among multiple 
regularization methods and path functions. They are designed for 
simplicity and flexibility, and the Matlab foundation ensures portability 
between platforms.  Both Radon_inverse and Radon_forward could be readily 
adapted or modified for a broad range of geophysical applications.
